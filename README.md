# Convert-from-speech-to-text-and-generate-a-response
- This project is a simple Python application that converts speech to text using the SpeechRecognition library
- Analyzes the extracted text and generates a relevant response using the Cohere API
- Supports text-to-speech conversion with gTTS and audio file processing with pydub. The workflow begins by uploading an audio file (preferably in WAV format), converting it if necessary, transcribing the audio into text, analyzing its meaning using AI tools, and finally generating a meaningful reply, which can also be converted back into speech. The goal is to demonstrate the integration of speech recognition, natural language understanding, and AI-powered response generation.
